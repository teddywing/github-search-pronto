GitHub Search Pronto
====================

A user script to search immediately within a GitHub repository without having to
wait for the drop-down to appear.

Since the search drop-down was added (enabling the search scope to be changed),
users must wait for the drop-down to both appear and populate before the Enter
key effectuates a search. This script allows the Enter key to be pressed without
having to wait for the drop-down to search within a repository.


## Install
Open the [raw script][1] and click “Install” in the resulting dialog. A [more
detailed explanation][2] is available on the Greasemonkey wiki.
